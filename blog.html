	<h3>CS 290 - Code Blog</h3>
	<h4><p><em>Looking for the

		<p>Assignment 0 - 9/25/2016</p>

		<p>The main thing that struck me with this assignment was that I needed to figure out how to use Git. I've never
			used Git or GitHub before<br> (shame on me), so I quickly familiarized myself with the website and features. I then
			had to decide whether or not I wanted to do the<br> assignment by using Notepad++ and uploading the files to the engineering
			server and GitHub via windows explorer, or if I wanted to be<br> more professional and learn how to use Git through SSH.
			I decided that in the long run it would be a better idea to learn Git, as it would<br> prove useful in later classes and
			as a skill in (probably most) professional environments. Git was fairly easy to figure out through a<br> combination of
			Github's tutorial and the slides posted on Piazza, and it ended up being a pretty cool tool to work with.</p>
			
			<p>I liked this assignment because it let me get a handle on basic HTML, Git usage, and page formatting. I feel like I
			actually learned a lot<br> of useful skills and information from this - especially since I know how to use Git now. It was also
			fun to try to figure out how to setup my<br> personal page on the engineering server and get everything formatted the way I wanted.
			Fun fact: you can use lists without list entries to<br> indent sections of text in a list-like manner that is aesthetically
			pleasing!</p>
			
			<p>All in all I found the assignment satisfying and not excruciatingly difficult. I'm looking forward to the next one!</p>
