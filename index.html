		<p>My name is Donald Elkins, but I go by "Trey". I am a second year Computer Science student from Beaverton, OR.</p>

		<p>One interesting fact about me is that I've lived in four different states: Illinois, Arkansas, Maryland, and Oregon. I arrived
			in the<br> Portland area about 5 years ago after a 2,900 mile drive across the United States in a leaky diesel moving van!</p>
		<p>On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give my web development skills a 5. I've done some <em>very</em> 
			basic HTML and CSS and have<br> basic familiarity with DreamWeaver, but I've never messed with JS, node, or SQL.</p>
		<p>In this class, I would like to learn how to create a modern professional website - even if it's something simple. That way I can
  		<br>generate my own digital resume or do basic design work.</p>
		<p>I have signed up for Piazza!</p>
